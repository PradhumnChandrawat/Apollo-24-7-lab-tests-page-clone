## Health Check Categories
# Grid Section
This project includes a grid section for showcasing various health check categories. Each category is represented by an image and a corresponding title.
Here I use CSS Grid Property for making this Section.

## Top Booked Tests Section
First I make a Scroll Section using <DIV> tag. 
position: relative;: This style establishes a positioning context for child elements within the container. It is often used when positioning child elements using position: absolute.

white-space: nowrap;: This style prevents text from wrapping to the next line, ensuring that content remains on a single line and creates a horizontal scrolling effect when it overflows.

overflow-x: auto;: This style adds a horizontal scrollbar to the container when the content overflows horizontally, allowing users to scroll through the content.

By combining these styles, you create a scrollable container that keeps its content on a single line and provides a horizontal scrollbar when necessary.

# Cards of this Scroll Section is divided into 2 parts

The card is divided into two main sections: "Upper" and "Lower."

The "Upper" section includes an image of the health test, the name of the test (Complete Blood Count or CBC), the number of tests included, and additional information about the value.

The "Lower" section includes details about the pricing, such as cashback, actual price, discounted price, and the percentage of discount. It also includes a button labeled "Add," which suggests an action related to adding the health test to a cart or similar functionality.

## Vital Organs Section 

Here, I also use Same CSS Grid Property for making these Grids.
